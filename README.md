# rust-athena
Ragnarok Online login and char servers reimplemented in rust

[WIP] For learning purpouses only -- Creates a local server that implements most of the packets used by login and character selection for Ragnarok Online.
The server also creates a default character.

## Tooling
[Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) - Monitor client-server communication.

[WARP](https://github.com/Neo-Mind/WARP) - Disable packet encryption on client-side
